# ADR YYY: Ability to Masquerade as GUID


## Context 

User with the `testing` role can log into the system and change their GUID this way they can more easily testing and fix data sets

## Decision 

We need to add a `role` field to the users table. That field can be any number of string types eg

`admin`

`tester`

`support`


It is only ONE value though.

We will focus on it being `tester` or `support` or `admin`

If a user has any one of these roles they will see on the screen a chance to change to a GUID in the top right menu.

If they click that option the will see a modal that will give them a field to enter the GUID to use.

Once they click save the `guid` field in their user row is changed AND their original `guid` is saved in the new field `original_guid` for later recovery.

Once the user is done they can click in the same menu `Switch Back`

In doing this it will replace the `guid` with the info in `original_quid` and null the `original_quid` so the UI knows they are not "masquerading" 

`original_guid` and `role` are protected fields in the model.

There is NO interface to set users to `testers` that will come later.

## Status 

"proposed"

## Consequences 

Users with roles tester, support or admin can masquerade as users

User will see their Guid in the menu
